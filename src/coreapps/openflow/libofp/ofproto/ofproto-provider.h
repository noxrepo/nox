 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Lots of ofproto data structures are only accessed from a single thread.
 * Those data structures are generally not thread-safe.
 *
 * The ofproto-dpif ofproto implementation accesses the flow table from
 * multiple threads, including modifying the flow table from multiple threads
 * via the "learn" action, so the flow table and various structures that index
 * it have been made thread-safe.  Refer to comments on individual data
 * structures for details.

 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Except near the beginning or ending of its lifespan, rule 'rule' belongs to
 * the classifier rule->ofproto->tables[rule->table_id].cls.  The text below
 * calls this classifier 'cls'.
 *
 * Motivation
 * ----------
 *
 * The thread safety rules described here for "struct rule" are motivated by
 * two goals:
 *
 *    - Prevent threads that read members of "struct rule" from reading bad
 *      data due to changes by some thread concurrently modifying those
 *      members.
 *
 *    - Prevent two threads making changes to members of a given "struct rule"
 *      from interfering with each other.
 *
 *
 * Rules
 * -----
 *
 * A rule 'rule' may be accessed without a risk of being freed by code that
 * holds a read-lock or write-lock on 'cls->rwlock' or that owns a reference to
 * 'rule->ref_count' (or both).  Code that needs to hold onto a rule for a
 * while should take 'cls->rwlock', find the rule it needs, increment
 * 'rule->ref_count' with ofproto_rule_ref(), and drop 'cls->rwlock'.
 *
 * 'rule->ref_count' protects 'rule' from being freed.  It doesn't protect the
 * rule from being deleted from 'cls' (that's 'cls->rwlock') and it doesn't
 * protect members of 'rule' from modification (that's 'rule->rwlock').
 *
 * 'rule->mutex' protects the members of 'rule' from modification.  It doesn't
 * protect the rule from being deleted from 'cls' (that's 'cls->rwlock') and it
 * doesn't prevent the rule from being freed (that's 'rule->ref_count').
 *
 * Regarding thread safety, the members of a rule fall into the following
 * categories:
 *
 *    - Immutable.  These members are marked 'const'.
 *
 *    - Members that may be safely read or written only by code holding
 *      ofproto_mutex.  These are marked OVS_GUARDED_BY(ofproto_mutex).
 *
 *    - Members that may be safely read only by code holding ofproto_mutex or
 *      'rule->mutex', and safely written only by coding holding ofproto_mutex
 *      AND 'rule->mutex'.  These are marked OVS_GUARDED.

 *
 *
 * Data Structures
 * ===============
 *
 * These functions work primarily with three different kinds of data
 * structures:
 *
 *   - "struct ofproto", which represents an OpenFlow switch.
 *
 *   - "struct ofport", which represents a port within an ofproto.
 *
 *   - "struct rule", which represents an OpenFlow flow within an ofproto.
 *
 * Each of these data structures contains all of the implementation-independent
 * generic state for the respective concept, called the "base" state.  None of
 * them contains any extra space for ofproto implementations to use.  Instead,
 * each implementation is expected to declare its own data structure that
 * contains an instance of the generic data structure plus additional
 * implementation-specific members, called the "derived" state.  The
 * implementation can use casts or (preferably) the CONTAINER_OF macro to
 * obtain access to derived state given only a pointer to the embedded generic
 * data structure.
 *
 *
 * Life Cycle
 * ==========
 *
 * Four stylized functions accompany each of these data structures:
 *
 *            "alloc"       "construct"       "destruct"       "dealloc"
 *            ------------  ----------------  ---------------  --------------
 *   ofproto  ->alloc       ->construct       ->destruct       ->dealloc
 *   ofport   ->port_alloc  ->port_construct  ->port_destruct  ->port_dealloc
 *   rule     ->rule_alloc  ->rule_construct  ->rule_destruct  ->rule_dealloc
 *
 * "ofproto" and "ofport" have this exact life cycle.  The "rule" data
 * structure also follow this life cycle with some additional elaborations
 * described under "Rule Life Cycle" below.
 *
 * Any instance of a given data structure goes through the following life
 * cycle:
 *
 *   1. The client calls the "alloc" function to obtain raw memory.  If "alloc"
 *      fails, skip all the other steps.
 *
 *   2. The client initializes all of the data structure's base state.  If this
 *      fails, skip to step 7.
 *
 *   3. The client calls the "construct" function.  The implementation
 *      initializes derived state.  It may refer to the already-initialized
 *      base state.  If "construct" fails, skip to step 6.
 *
 *   4. The data structure is now initialized and in use.
 *
 *   5. When the data structure is no longer needed, the client calls the
 *      "destruct" function.  The implementation uninitializes derived state.
 *      The base state has not been uninitialized yet, so the implementation
 *      may still refer to it.
 *
 *   6. The client uninitializes all of the data structure's base state.
 *
 *   7. The client calls the "dealloc" to free the raw memory.  The
 *      implementation must not refer to base or derived state in the data
 *      structure, because it has already been uninitialized.
 *
 * Each "alloc" function allocates and returns a new instance of the respective
 * data structure.  The "alloc" function is not given any information about the
 * use of the new data structure, so it cannot perform much initialization.
 * Its purpose is just to ensure that the new data structure has enough room
 * for base and derived state.  It may return a null pointer if memory is not
 * available, in which case none of the other functions is called.
 *
 * Each "construct" function initializes derived state in its respective data
 * structure.  When "construct" is called, all of the base state has already
 * been initialized, so the "construct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "construct" function is allowed to fail, in which case the client calls the
 * "dealloc" function (but not the "destruct" function).
 *
 * Each "destruct" function uninitializes and frees derived state in its
 * respective data structure.  When "destruct" is called, the base state has
 * not yet been uninitialized, so the "destruct" function may refer to it.  The
 * "destruct" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 * Each "dealloc" function frees raw memory that was allocated by the the
 * "alloc" function.  The memory's base and derived members might not have ever
 * been initialized (but if "construct" returned successfully, then it has been
 * "destruct"ed already).  The "dealloc" function is not allowed to fail.
 *
 *
 * Conventions
 * ===========
 *
 * Most of these functions return 0 if they are successful or a positive error
 * code on failure.  Depending on the function, valid error codes are either
 * errno values or OFPERR_* OpenFlow error codes.
 *
 * Most of these functions are expected to execute synchronously, that is, to
 * block as necessary to obtain a result.  Thus, these functions may return
 * EAGAIN (or EWOULDBLOCK or EINPROGRESS) only where the function descriptions
 * explicitly say those errors are a possibility.  We may relax this
 * requirement in the future if and when we encounter performance problems. */

     * Construction
     * ============
     *
     * ->construct() should not modify any base members of the ofproto.  The
     * client will initialize the ofproto's 'ports' and 'tables' members after
     * construction is complete.
     *
     * When ->construct() is called, the client does not yet know how many flow
     * tables the datapath supports, so ofproto->n_tables will be 0 and
     * ofproto->tables will be NULL.  ->construct() should call
     * ofproto_init_tables() to allocate and initialize ofproto->n_tables and
     * ofproto->tables.  Each flow table will be initially empty, so
     * ->construct() should delete flows from the underlying datapath, if
     * necessary, rather than populating the tables.
     *
     * If the ofproto knows the maximum port number that the datapath can have,
     * then it can call ofproto_init_max_ports().  If it does so, then the
     * client will ensure that the actions it allows to be used through
     * OpenFlow do not refer to ports above that maximum number.
     *
     * Only one ofproto instance needs to be supported for any given datapath.
     * If a datapath is already open as part of one "ofproto", then another
     * attempt to "construct" the same datapath as part of another ofproto is
     * allowed to fail with an error.

     * (Thus, there is a multi-step process for any rule currently being
     * inserted or modified at the beginning of destruction: first
     * ofoperation_complete() that operation, then ofproto_rule_delete() the
     * rule, then ofoperation_complete() the deletion operation.)

     * have already been iterated.  Otherwise, on error, it should return a
     * positive errno value.  This function will not be called again once it
     * returns nonzero once for a given iteration (but the 'port_dump_done'
     * function will be called afterward).
     *

     *        visible in flow table lookups.
     *

     *        implementation calls ofoperation_complete() to indicate that the
     *        insertion completed.  If the operation failed, skip to step 5.
     *
     *   4.3. The rule is now installed in the flow table.  Eventually it will
     *        be deleted.
     *
     *   4.4. The client removes the rule from the flow table.  It is no longer
     *        visible in flow table lookups.
     *
     *   4.5. The client calls "rule_delete".  Immediately or eventually, the

     *        be successful.
     *
     *
     * Asynchronous Operation Support
     * ==============================
     *
     * The "insert" and "delete" life-cycle operations on rules can operate
     * asynchronously, meaning that ->rule_insert() and ->rule_delete() only
     * need to initiate their respective operations and do not need to wait for
     * them to complete before they return.  ->rule_modify_actions() also
     * operates asynchronously.
     *
     * An ofproto implementation reports the success or failure of an
     * asynchronous operation on a rule using the rule's 'pending' member,
     * which points to a opaque "struct ofoperation" that represents the
     * ongoing operation.  When the operation completes, the ofproto
     * implementation calls ofoperation_complete(), passing the ofoperation and
     * an error indication.
     *
     * Only the following contexts may call ofoperation_complete():
     *
     *   - The function called to initiate the operation, e.g. ->rule_insert()
     *     or ->rule_delete().  This is the best choice if the operation
     *     completes quickly.
     *
     *   - The implementation's ->run() function.
     *
     *   - The implementation's ->destruct() function.
     *
     * The ofproto base code updates the flow table optimistically, assuming
     * that the operation will probably succeed:
     *
     *   - ofproto adds the rule in the flow table before calling
     *     ->rule_insert().
     *
     *   - ofproto updates the rule's actions and other properties before
     *     calling ->rule_modify_actions().
     *
     *   - ofproto removes the rule before calling ->rule_delete().
     *
     * With one exception, when an asynchronous operation completes with an
     * error, ofoperation_complete() backs out the already applied changes:
     *
     *   - If adding a rule in the flow table fails, ofproto removes the new
     *     rule.
     *
     *   - If modifying a rule fails, ofproto restores the original actions
     *     (and other properties).
     *
     *   - Removing a rule is not allowed to fail.  It must always succeed.
     *
     * The ofproto base code serializes operations: if any operation is in
     * progress on a given rule, ofproto postpones initiating any new operation
     * on that rule until the pending operation completes.  Therefore, every
     * operation must eventually complete through a call to
     * ofoperation_complete() to avoid delaying new operations indefinitely
     * (including any OpenFlow request that affects the rule in question, even
     * just to query its statistics).
     *
     *
     * Construction
     * ============
     *
     * When ->rule_construct() is called, 'rule' is a new rule that is not yet
     * inserted into a flow table.  ->rule_construct() should initialize enough
     * of the rule's derived state for 'rule' to be suitable for inserting into
     * a flow table.  ->rule_construct() should not modify any base members of
     * struct rule.
     *
     * If ->rule_construct() fails (as indicated by returning a nonzero
     * OpenFlow error code), the ofproto base code will uninitialize and
     * deallocate 'rule'.  See "Rule Life Cycle" above for more details.
     *
     * ->rule_construct() may also:
     *
     *   - Validate that the datapath supports the matching rule in 'rule->cr'
     *     datapath.  For example, if the rule's table does not support
     *     registers, then it is an error if 'rule->cr' does not wildcard all
     *     registers.
     *
     *   - Validate that the datapath can correctly implement 'rule->ofpacts'.
     *
     * Some implementations might need to defer these tasks to ->rule_insert(),
     * which is also acceptable.
     *
     *
     * Insertion
     * =========
     *
     * Following successful construction, the ofproto base case inserts 'rule'
     * into its flow table, then it calls ->rule_insert().  ->rule_insert()
     * should set in motion adding the new rule to the datapath flow table.  It
     * must act as follows:
     *
     *   - If it completes insertion, either by succeeding or failing, it must
     *     call ofoperation_complete()
     *
     *   - If insertion is only partially complete, then it must return without
     *     calling ofoperation_complete().  Later, when the insertion is
     *     complete, the ->run() or ->destruct() function must call
     *     ofoperation_complete() to report success or failure.
     *
     * If ->rule_insert() fails, the ofproto base code will remove 'rule' from
     * the flow table, destruct, uninitialize, and deallocate 'rule'.  See
     * "Rule Life Cycle" above for more details.
     *
     *
     * Deletion
     * ========
     *
     * The ofproto base code removes 'rule' from its flow table before it calls
     * ->rule_delete().  ->rule_delete() should set in motion removing 'rule'
     * from the datapath flow table.  It must act as follows:
     *
     *   - If it completes deletion, it must call ofoperation_complete().
     *
     *   - If deletion is only partially complete, then it must return without
     *     calling ofoperation_complete().  Later, when the deletion is
     *     complete, the ->run() or ->destruct() function must call
     *     ofoperation_complete().
     *
     * Rule deletion must not fail.
     *
     *
     * Destruction
     * ===========
     *
     * ->rule_destruct() must uninitialize derived state.
     *
     * Rule destruction must not fail. */
