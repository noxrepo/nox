/* High-level wrapper around the "poll" system call.
 *
 * The intended usage is for each thread's main loop to go about its business
 * servicing whatever events it needs to.  Then, when it runs out of immediate
 * tasks, it calls each subordinate module's "wait" function, which in turn
 * calls one (or more) of the functions poll_fd_wait(), poll_immediate_wake(),
 * and poll_timer_wait() to register to be awakened when the appropriate event
 * occurs.  Then the main loop calls poll_block(), which blocks until one of
 * the registered events happens.
 *
 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * The poll set is per-thread, so all functions in this module are thread-safe.

 * a function and a macro wrapper.  The macro version automatically supplies
 * the source code location of the caller.  The function version allows the
 * caller to supply a location explicitly, which is useful if the caller's own
 * caller would be more useful in log output.  See timer_wait_at() for an
