/* This library implements a finite-state machine for connecting and
 * reconnecting to a network resource with exponential backoff.  It also
 * provides optional support for detecting a connection on which the peer is no
 * longer responding.
 *
 * The library does not implement anything networking related, only an FSM for
 * networking code to use.
 *
 * Many "reconnect" functions take a "now" argument.  This makes testing easier
 * since there is no hidden state.  When not testing, just pass the return
 * value of time_msec() from timeval.h.  (Perhaps this design should be
 * revisited later.) */
