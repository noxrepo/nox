/* Nicira vendor-specific error messages extension.
 *
 * OpenFlow 1.0 has a set of predefined error types (OFPET_*) and codes (which
 * are specific to each type).  It does not have any provision for
 * vendor-specific error codes, and it does not even provide "generic" error
 * codes that can apply to problems not anticipated by the OpenFlow
 * specification authors.
 *
 * This extension attempts to address the problem by adding a generic "error
 * vendor extension".  The extension works as follows: use NXET_VENDOR as type
 * and NXVC_VENDOR_ERROR as code, followed by struct nx_vendor_error with
 * vendor-specific details, followed by at least 64 bytes of the failed
 * request.
 *
 * It would be better to have a type-specific vendor extension, e.g. so that
 * OFPET_BAD_ACTION could be used with vendor-specific code values.  But
 * OFPET_BAD_ACTION and most other standardized types already specify that
 * their 'data' values are (the start of) the OpenFlow message being replied
 * to, so there is no room to insert a vendor ID.
 *
 * Currently this extension is only implemented by Open vSwitch, but it seems
 * like a reasonable candidate for future standardization.

/* This command enables or disables an Open vSwitch extension that allows a

 * required by OpenFlow 1.0.  Because NXM was designed as an extension to
 * OpenFlow 1.0, the extension applies equally to ofp10_flow_mod and
 * nx_flow_mod.  By default, the extension is disabled.
 *
 * When this feature is enabled, Open vSwitch treats struct ofp10_flow_mod's
 * and struct nx_flow_mod's 16-bit 'command' member as two separate fields.
 * The upper 8 bits are used as the table ID, the lower 8 bits specify the
 * command as usual.  A table ID of 0xff is treated like a wildcarded table ID.
 *
 * The specific treatment of the table ID depends on the type of flow mod:
 *
 *    - OFPFC_ADD: Given a specific table ID, the flow is always placed in that
 *      table.  If an identical flow already exists in that table only, then it
 *      is replaced.  If the flow cannot be placed in the specified table,
 *      either because the table is full or because the table cannot support
 *      flows of the given type, the switch replies with an OFPFMFC_TABLE_FULL
 *      error.  (A controller can distinguish these cases by comparing the
 *      current and maximum number of entries reported in ofp_table_stats.)
 *
 *      If the table ID is wildcarded, the switch picks an appropriate table
 *      itself.  If an identical flow already exist in the selected flow table,
 *      then it is replaced.  The choice of table might depend on the flows
 *      that are already in the switch; for example, if one table fills up then
 *      the switch might fall back to another one.
 *
 *    - OFPFC_MODIFY, OFPFC_DELETE: Given a specific table ID, only flows
 *      within that table are matched and modified or deleted.  If the table ID
 *      is wildcarded, flows within any table may be matched and modified or
 *      deleted.
 *
 *    - OFPFC_MODIFY_STRICT, OFPFC_DELETE_STRICT: Given a specific table ID,
 *      only a flow within that table may be matched and modified or deleted.
 *      If the table ID is wildcarded and exactly one flow within any table
 *      matches, then it is modified or deleted; if flows in more than one
 *      table match, then none is modified or deleted.

 *       message.  (OpenFlow 1.3 OFPT_PACKET_IN also includes the cookie.)
 *
 *     - The metadata fields use NXM (instead of OXM) field numbers.
 *
 * Open vSwitch 1.9.0 and later omits metadata fields that are zero (as allowed
 * by OpenFlow 1.2).  Earlier versions included all implemented metadata
 * fields.
 *
 * Open vSwitch does not include non-metadata in the nx_match, because by
 * definition that information can be found in the packet itself.  The format
 * and the standards allow this, however, so controllers should be prepared to
 * tolerate future changes.
 *
 * The NXM format is convenient for reporting metadata values, but it is
 * important not to interpret the format as matching against a flow, because it
 * does not.  Nothing is being matched; arbitrary metadata masks would not be
 * meaningful.
 *
 * Whereas in most cases a controller can expect to only get back NXM fields
 * that it set up itself (e.g. flow dumps will ordinarily report only NXM
 * fields from flows that the controller added), NXT_PACKET_IN messages might
 * contain fields that the controller does not understand, because the switch
 * might support fields (new registers, new protocols, etc.) that the
 * controller does not.  The controller must prepared to tolerate these.

 *      resubmit action, then the flow is updated with the new values.
 *
 * Following the lookup, the original in_port is restored.
 *

 *     header (if any), ignoring the other bits.  Setting a value with CFI=1

 *     to the field's new value (with the CFI bit masked out).
 *
 *   - NXM_NX_TUN_ID, NXM_NX_TUN_IPV4_SRC, NXM_NX_TUN_IPV4_DST.  Modifying

 *     configuration of the output tunnel port.
 *
 * A given nxm_header value may be used as 'src' or 'dst' only on a flow whose
 * nx_match satisfies its prerequisites.  For example, NXM_OF_IP_TOS may be
 * used only if the flow's nx_match includes an nxm_entry that specifies
 * nxm_type=NXM_OF_ETH_TYPE, nxm_hasmask=0, and nxm_value=0x0800.

 *
 * This action behaves properly when 'src' overlaps with 'dst', that is, it
 * behaves as if 'src' were copied out to a temporary buffer, then the

/* Action structure for NXAST_LEARN.
 *
 * This action adds or modifies a flow in an OpenFlow table, similar to
 * OFPT_FLOW_MOD with OFPFC_MODIFY_STRICT as 'command'.  The new flow has the
 * specified idle timeout, hard timeout, priority, cookie, and flags.  The new
 * flow's match criteria and actions are built by applying each of the series
 * of flow_mod_spec elements included as part of the action.
 *
 * A flow_mod_spec starts with a 16-bit header.  A header that is all-bits-0 is
 * a no-op used for padding the action as a whole to a multiple of 8 bytes in
 * length.  Otherwise, the flow_mod_spec can be thought of as copying 'n_bits'
 * bits from a source to a destination.  In this case, the header contains
 * multiple fields:
 *
 *  15  14  13 12  11 10                              0
 * +------+---+------+---------------------------------+
 * |   0  |src|  dst |             n_bits              |
 * +------+---+------+---------------------------------+
 *
 * The meaning and format of a flow_mod_spec depends on 'src' and 'dst'.  The
 * following table summarizes the meaning of each possible combination.
 * Details follow the table:
 *
 *   src dst  meaning
 *   --- ---  ----------------------------------------------------------
 *    0   0   Add match criteria based on value in a field.
 *    1   0   Add match criteria based on an immediate value.
 *    0   1   Add NXAST_REG_LOAD action to copy field into a different field.
 *    1   1   Add NXAST_REG_LOAD action to load immediate value into a field.
 *    0   2   Add OFPAT_OUTPUT action to output to port from specified field.
 *   All other combinations are undefined and not allowed.
 *
 * The flow_mod_spec header is followed by a source specification and a
 * destination specification.  The format and meaning of the source
 * specification depends on 'src':
 *
 *   - If 'src' is 0, the source bits are taken from a field in the flow to
 *     which this action is attached.  (This should be a wildcarded field.  If
 *     its value is fully specified then the source bits being copied have
 *     constant values.)
 *
 *     The source specification is an ovs_be32 'field' and an ovs_be16 'ofs'.
 *     'field' is an nxm_header with nxm_hasmask=0, and 'ofs' the starting bit
 *     offset within that field.  The source bits are field[ofs:ofs+n_bits-1].
 *     'field' and 'ofs' are subject to the same restrictions as the source
 *     field in NXAST_REG_MOVE.
 *
 *   - If 'src' is 1, the source bits are a constant value.  The source
 *     specification is (n_bits+15)/16*2 bytes long.  Taking those bytes as a
 *     number in network order, the source bits are the 'n_bits'
 *     least-significant bits.  The switch will report an error if other bits
 *     in the constant are nonzero.
 *
 * The flow_mod_spec destination specification, for 'dst' of 0 or 1, is an
 * ovs_be32 'field' and an ovs_be16 'ofs'.  'field' is an nxm_header with
 * nxm_hasmask=0 and 'ofs' is a starting bit offset within that field.  The
 * meaning of the flow_mod_spec depends on 'dst':
 *
 *   - If 'dst' is 0, the flow_mod_spec specifies match criteria for the new
 *     flow.  The new flow matches only if bits field[ofs:ofs+n_bits-1] in a
 *     packet equal the source bits.  'field' may be any nxm_header with
 *     nxm_hasmask=0 that is allowed in NXT_FLOW_MOD.
 *
 *     Order is significant.  Earlier flow_mod_specs must satisfy any
 *     prerequisites for matching fields specified later, by copying constant
 *     values into prerequisite fields.
 *
 *     The switch will reject flow_mod_specs that do not satisfy NXM masking
 *     restrictions.
 *
 *   - If 'dst' is 1, the flow_mod_spec specifies an NXAST_REG_LOAD action for
 *     the new flow.  The new flow copies the source bits into
 *     field[ofs:ofs+n_bits-1].  Actions are executed in the same order as the
 *     flow_mod_specs.
 *
 *     A single NXAST_REG_LOAD action writes no more than 64 bits, so n_bits
 *     greater than 64 yields multiple NXAST_REG_LOAD actions.
 *
 * The flow_mod_spec destination spec for 'dst' of 2 (when 'src' is 0) is
 * empty.  It has the following meaning:
 *
 *   - The flow_mod_spec specifies an OFPAT_OUTPUT action for the new flow.
 *     The new flow outputs to the OpenFlow port specified by the source field.
 *     Of the special output ports with value OFPP_MAX or larger, OFPP_IN_PORT,
 *     OFPP_FLOOD, OFPP_LOCAL, and OFPP_ALL are supported.  Other special ports
 *     may not be used.
 *
 * Resource Management
 * -------------------
 *
 * A switch has a finite amount of flow table space available for learning.
 * When this space is exhausted, no new learning table entries will be learned
 * until some existing flow table entries expire.  The controller should be
 * prepared to handle this by flooding (which can be implemented as a
 * low-priority flow).
 *
 * If a learned flow matches a single TCP stream with a relatively long
 * timeout, one may make the best of resource constraints by setting
 * 'fin_idle_timeout' or 'fin_hard_timeout' (both measured in seconds), or
 * both, to shorter timeouts.  When either of these is specified as a nonzero
 * value, OVS adds a NXAST_FIN_TIMEOUT action, with the specified timeouts, to
 * the learned flow.
 *
 * Examples
 * --------
 *
 * The following examples give a prose description of the flow_mod_specs along
 * with informal notation for how those would be represented and a hex dump of
 * the bytes that would be required.
 *
 * These examples could work with various nx_action_learn parameters.  Typical
 * values would be idle_timeout=OFP_FLOW_PERMANENT, hard_timeout=60,
 * priority=OFP_DEFAULT_PRIORITY, flags=0, table_id=10.
 *
 * 1. Learn input port based on the source MAC, with lookup into
 *    NXM_NX_REG1[16:31] by resubmit to in_port=99:
 *
 *    Match on in_port=99:
 *       ovs_be16(src=1, dst=0, n_bits=16),               20 10
 *       ovs_be16(99),                                    00 63
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_IN_PORT), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 00 02 00 00
 *
 *    Match Ethernet destination on Ethernet source from packet:
 *       ovs_be16(src=0, dst=0, n_bits=48),               00 30
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_ETH_SRC), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 04 06 00 00
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_ETH_DST), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 02 06 00 00
 *
 *    Set NXM_NX_REG1[16:31] to the packet's input port:
 *       ovs_be16(src=0, dst=1, n_bits=16),               08 10
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_IN_PORT), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 00 02 00 00
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_NX_REG1), ovs_be16(16)              00 01 02 04 00 10
 *
 *    Given a packet that arrived on port A with Ethernet source address B,
 *    this would set up the flow "in_port=99, dl_dst=B,
 *    actions=load:A->NXM_NX_REG1[16..31]".
 *
 *    In syntax accepted by ovs-ofctl, this action is: learn(in_port=99,
 *    NXM_OF_ETH_DST[]=NXM_OF_ETH_SRC[],
 *    load:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]->NXM_NX_REG1[16..31])
 *
 * 2. Output to input port based on the source MAC and VLAN VID, with lookup
 *    into NXM_NX_REG1[16:31]:
 *
 *    Match on same VLAN ID as packet:
 *       ovs_be16(src=0, dst=0, n_bits=12),               00 0c
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI), ovs_be16(0)           00 00 08 02 00 00
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI), ovs_be16(0)           00 00 08 02 00 00
 *
 *    Match Ethernet destination on Ethernet source from packet:
 *       ovs_be16(src=0, dst=0, n_bits=48),               00 30
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_ETH_SRC), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 04 06 00 00
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_ETH_DST), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 02 06 00 00
 *
 *    Output to the packet's input port:
 *       ovs_be16(src=0, dst=2, n_bits=16),               10 10
 *       ovs_be32(NXM_OF_IN_PORT), ovs_be16(0)            00 00 00 02 00 00
 *
 *    Given a packet that arrived on port A with Ethernet source address B in
 *    VLAN C, this would set up the flow "dl_dst=B, vlan_vid=C,
 *    actions=output:A".
 *
 *    In syntax accepted by ovs-ofctl, this action is:
 *    learn(NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI[0..11], NXM_OF_ETH_DST[]=NXM_OF_ETH_SRC[],
 *    output:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[])
 *
 * 3. Here's a recipe for a very simple-minded MAC learning switch.  It uses a
 *    10-second MAC expiration time to make it easier to see what's going on

 *
 * Usage Advice
 * ------------
 *
 * For best performance, segregate learned flows into a table that is not used
 * for any other flows except possibly for a lowest-priority "catch-all" flow
 * (a flow with no match criteria).  If different learning actions specify
 * different match criteria, use different tables for the learned flows.
 *
 * The meaning of 'hard_timeout' and 'idle_timeout' can be counterintuitive.
 * These timeouts apply to the flow that is added, which means that a flow with
 * an idle timeout will expire when no traffic has been sent *to* the learned
 * address.  This is not usually the intent in MAC learning; instead, we want
 * the MAC learn entry to expire when no traffic has been sent *from* the
 * learned address.  Use a hard timeout for that.

 * to 'fin_idle_timeout' and its hard timeout to 'fin_hard_timeout'.  This

 * This is useful for quickly discarding learned TCP flows that otherwise will
 * take a long time to expire.
 *
 * This action is intended for use with an OpenFlow rule that matches only a
 * single TCP flow.  If the rule matches multiple TCP flows (e.g. it wildcards
 * all TCP traffic, or all TCP traffic to a particular port), then any FIN or

/* Action structure for NXAST_BUNDLE and NXAST_BUNDLE_LOAD.
 *
 * The bundle actions choose a slave from a supplied list of options.
 * NXAST_BUNDLE outputs to its selection.  NXAST_BUNDLE_LOAD writes its
 * selection to a register.
 *
 * The list of possible slaves follows the nx_action_bundle structure. The size
 * of each slave is governed by its type as indicated by the 'slave_type'
 * parameter. The list of slaves should be padded at its end with zeros to make
 * the total length of the action a multiple of 8.
 *
 * Switches infer from the 'slave_type' parameter the size of each slave.  All
 * implementations must support the NXM_OF_IN_PORT 'slave_type' which indicates
 * that the slaves are OpenFlow port numbers with NXM_LENGTH(NXM_OF_IN_PORT) ==
 * 2 byte width.  Switches should reject actions which indicate unknown or
 * unsupported slave types.
 *
 * Switches use a strategy dictated by the 'algorithm' parameter to choose a
 * slave.  If the switch does not support the specified 'algorithm' parameter,
 * it should reject the action.
 *
 * Several algorithms take into account liveness when selecting slaves.  The
 * liveness of a slave is implementation defined (with one exception), but will
 * generally take into account things like its carrier status and the results
 * of any link monitoring protocols which happen to be running on it.  In order
 * to give controllers a place-holder value, the OFPP_NONE port is always
 * considered live.
 *
 * Some slave selection strategies require the use of a hash function, in which
 * case the 'fields' and 'basis' parameters should be populated.  The 'fields'
 * parameter (one of NX_HASH_FIELDS_*) designates which parts of the flow to
 * hash.  Refer to the definition of "enum nx_hash_fields" for details.  The
 * 'basis' parameter is used as a universal hash parameter.  Different values
 * of 'basis' yield different hash results.
 *
 * The 'zero' parameter at the end of the action structure is reserved for
 * future use.  Switches are required to reject actions which have nonzero
 * bytes in the 'zero' field.
 *
 * NXAST_BUNDLE actions should have 'ofs_nbits' and 'dst' zeroed.  Switches
 * should reject actions which have nonzero bytes in either of these fields.
 *

/* Flexible flow specifications (aka NXM = Nicira Extended Match).
 *
 * OpenFlow 1.0 has "struct ofp10_match" for specifying flow matches.  This
 * structure is fixed-length and hence difficult to extend.  This section
 * describes a more flexible, variable-length flow match, called "nx_match" for
 * short, that is also supported by Open vSwitch.  This section also defines a
 * replacement for each OpenFlow message that includes struct ofp10_match.
 *
 *
 * Format
 * ======
 *
 * An nx_match is a sequence of zero or more "nxm_entry"s, which are
 * type-length-value (TLV) entries, each 5 to 259 (inclusive) bytes long.
 * "nxm_entry"s are not aligned on or padded to any multibyte boundary.  The
 * first 4 bytes of an nxm_entry are its "header", followed by the entry's
 * "body".
 *
 * An nxm_entry's header is interpreted as a 32-bit word in network byte order:
 *
 * |<-------------------- nxm_type ------------------>|
 * |                                                  |
 * |31                              16 15            9| 8 7                0
 * +----------------------------------+---------------+--+------------------+
 * |            nxm_vendor            |   nxm_field   |hm|    nxm_length    |
 * +----------------------------------+---------------+--+------------------+
 *
 * The most-significant 23 bits of the header are collectively "nxm_type".
 * Bits 16...31 are "nxm_vendor", one of the NXM_VENDOR_* values below.  Bits
 * 9...15 are "nxm_field", which is a vendor-specific value.  nxm_type normally
 * designates a protocol header, such as the Ethernet type, but it can also
 * refer to packet metadata, such as the switch port on which a packet arrived.
 *
 * Bit 8 is "nxm_hasmask" (labeled "hm" above for space reasons).  The meaning
 * of this bit is explained later.
 *
 * The least-significant 8 bits are "nxm_length", a positive integer.  The
 * length of the nxm_entry, including the header, is exactly 4 + nxm_length
 * bytes.
 *
 * For a given nxm_vendor, nxm_field, and nxm_hasmask value, nxm_length is a
 * constant.  It is included only to allow software to minimally parse
 * "nxm_entry"s of unknown types.  (Similarly, for a given nxm_vendor,
 * nxm_field, and nxm_length, nxm_hasmask is a constant.)
 *
 *
 * Semantics
 * =========
 *
 * A zero-length nx_match (one with no "nxm_entry"s) matches every packet.
 *
 * An nxm_entry places a constraint on the packets matched by the nx_match:
 *
 *   - If nxm_hasmask is 0, the nxm_entry's body contains a value for the
 *     field, called "nxm_value".  The nx_match matches only packets in which
 *     the field equals nxm_value.
 *
 *   - If nxm_hasmask is 1, then the nxm_entry's body contains a value for the
 *     field (nxm_value), followed by a bitmask of the same length as the
 *     value, called "nxm_mask".  For each 1-bit in position J in nxm_mask, the
 *     nx_match matches only packets for which bit J in the given field's value
 *     matches bit J in nxm_value.  A 0-bit in nxm_mask causes the
 *     corresponding bit in nxm_value is ignored (it should be 0; Open vSwitch
 *     may enforce this someday), as is the corresponding bit in the field's
 *     value.  (The sense of the nxm_mask bits is the opposite of that used by
 *     the "wildcards" member of struct ofp10_match.)
 *
 *     When nxm_hasmask is 1, nxm_length is always even.
 *
 *     An all-zero-bits nxm_mask is equivalent to omitting the nxm_entry
 *     entirely.  An all-one-bits nxm_mask is equivalent to specifying 0 for
 *     nxm_hasmask.
 *
 * When there are multiple "nxm_entry"s, all of the constraints must be met.
 *
 *
 * Mask Restrictions
 * =================
 *
 * Masks may be restricted:
 *
 *   - Some nxm_types may not support masked wildcards, that is, nxm_hasmask
 *     must always be 0 when these fields are specified.  For example, the
 *     field that identifies the port on which a packet was received may not be
 *     masked.
 *
 *   - Some nxm_types that do support masked wildcards may only support certain
 *     nxm_mask patterns.  For example, fields that have IPv4 address values
 *     may be restricted to CIDR masks.
 *
 * These restrictions should be noted in specifications for individual fields.
 * A switch may accept an nxm_hasmask or nxm_mask value that the specification
 * disallows, if the switch correctly implements support for that nxm_hasmask
 * or nxm_mask value.  A switch must reject an attempt to set up a flow that
 * contains a nxm_hasmask or nxm_mask value that it does not support.
 *
 *
 * Prerequisite Restrictions
 * =========================
 *
 * The presence of an nxm_entry with a given nxm_type may be restricted based
 * on the presence of or values of other "nxm_entry"s.  For example:
 *
 *   - An nxm_entry for nxm_type=NXM_OF_IP_TOS is allowed only if it is
 *     preceded by another entry with nxm_type=NXM_OF_ETH_TYPE, nxm_hasmask=0,
 *     and nxm_value=0x0800.  That is, matching on the IP source address is
 *     allowed only if the Ethernet type is explicitly set to IP.
 *
 *   - An nxm_entry for nxm_type=NXM_OF_TCP_SRC is allowed only if it is
 *     preceded by an entry with nxm_type=NXM_OF_ETH_TYPE, nxm_hasmask=0, and
 *     nxm_value either 0x0800 or 0x86dd, and another with
 *     nxm_type=NXM_OF_IP_PROTO, nxm_hasmask=0, nxm_value=6, in that order.
 *     That is, matching on the TCP source port is allowed only if the Ethernet
 *     type is IP or IPv6 and the IP protocol is TCP.
 *
 * These restrictions should be noted in specifications for individual fields.
 * A switch may implement relaxed versions of these restrictions.  A switch
 * must reject an attempt to set up a flow that violates its restrictions.
 *
 *
 * Ordering Restrictions
 * =====================
 *
 * An nxm_entry that has prerequisite restrictions must appear after the
 * "nxm_entry"s for its prerequisites.  Ordering of "nxm_entry"s within an
 * nx_match is not otherwise constrained.
 *
 * Any given nxm_type may appear in an nx_match at most once.
 *
 *
 * nxm_entry Examples
 * ==================
 *
 * These examples show the format of a single nxm_entry with particular
 * nxm_hasmask and nxm_length values.  The diagrams are labeled with field
 * numbers and byte indexes.
 *

 * |   header   |     nxm_value    |      nxm_mask    |
 * +------------+------------------+------------------+
 *
 *
 * Error Reporting
 * ===============
 *
 * A switch should report an error in an nx_match using error type
 * OFPET_BAD_REQUEST and one of the NXBRC_NXM_* codes.  Ideally the switch
 * should report a specific error code, if one is assigned for the particular
 * problem, but NXBRC_NXM_INVALID is also available to report a generic
 * nx_match error.

 *   - In OFPC_FRAG_DROP mode, the OpenFlow switch drops all IP fragments

 *     matching will have value 0 in this field.
 *
 *   - Open vSwitch does not implement OFPC_FRAG_REASM mode, but if it did then
 *     IP fragments would be reassembled before they reached the flow table and
 *     again every packet available for matching would always have value 0.
 *
 *   - In OFPC_FRAG_NORMAL mode, all three values are possible, but OpenFlow
 *     1.0 says that fragments' transport ports are always 0, even for the
 *     first fragment, so this does not provide much extra information.
 *
 *   - In OFPC_FRAG_NX_MATCH mode, all three values are possible.  For
 *     fragments with offset 0, Open vSwitch makes L4 header information

/* Flow Table Monitoring
 * =====================
 *
 * NXST_FLOW_MONITOR allows a controller to keep track of changes to OpenFlow
 * flow table(s) or subsets of them, with the following workflow:
 *
 * 1. The controller sends an NXST_FLOW_MONITOR request to begin monitoring
 *    flows.  The 'id' in the request must be unique among all monitors that
 *    the controller has started and not yet canceled on this OpenFlow
 *    connection.
 *
 * 2. The switch responds with an NXST_FLOW_MONITOR reply.  If the request's
 *    'flags' included NXFMF_INITIAL, the reply includes all the flows that
 *    matched the request at the time of the request (with event NXFME_ADDED).
 *    If 'flags' did not include NXFMF_INITIAL, the reply is empty.
 *
 *    The reply uses the xid of the request (as do all replies to OpenFlow
 *    requests).
 *
 * 3. Whenever a change to a flow table entry matches some outstanding monitor
 *    request's criteria and flags, the switch sends a notification to the
 *    controller as an additional NXST_FLOW_MONITOR reply with xid 0.
 *
 *    When multiple outstanding monitors match a single change, only a single
 *    notification is sent.  This merged notification includes the information
 *    requested in any of the individual monitors.  That is, if any of the
 *    matching monitors requests actions (NXFMF_ACTIONS), the notification
 *    includes actions, and if any of the monitors request full changes for the
 *    controller's own changes (NXFMF_OWN), the controller's own changes will
 *    be included in full.
 *
 * 4. The controller may cancel a monitor with NXT_FLOW_MONITOR_CANCEL.  No
 *    further notifications will be sent on the basis of the canceled monitor
 *    afterward.
 *
 *
 * Buffer Management
 * =================
 *
 * OpenFlow messages for flow monitor notifications can overflow the buffer
 * space available to the switch, either temporarily (e.g. due to network
 * conditions slowing OpenFlow traffic) or more permanently (e.g. the sustained
 * rate of flow table change exceeds the network bandwidth between switch and
 * controller).
 *
 * When Open vSwitch's notification buffer space reaches a limiting threshold,
 * OVS reacts as follows:
 *
 * 1. OVS sends an NXT_FLOW_MONITOR_PAUSED message to the controller, following
 *    all the already queued notifications.  After it receives this message,
 *    the controller knows that its view of the flow table, as represented by
 *    flow monitor notifications, is incomplete.
 *
 * 2. As long as the notification buffer is not empty:
 *
 *        - NXMFE_ADD and NXFME_MODIFIED notifications will not be sent.
 *
 *        - NXFME_DELETED notifications will still be sent, but only for flows
 *          that existed before OVS sent NXT_FLOW_MONITOR_PAUSED.
 *
 *        - NXFME_ABBREV notifications will not be sent.  They are treated as
 *          the expanded version (and therefore only the NXFME_DELETED
 *          components, if any, are sent).
 *
 * 3. When the notification buffer empties, OVS sends NXFME_ADD notifications
 *    for flows added since the buffer reached its limit and NXFME_MODIFIED
 *    notifications for flows that existed before the limit was reached and
 *    changed after the limit was reached.
 *
 * 4. OVS sends an NXT_FLOW_MONITOR_RESUMED message to the controller.  After
 *    it receives this message, the controller knows that its view of the flow
 *    table, as represented by flow monitor notifications, is again complete.
 *
 * This allows the maximum buffer space requirement for notifications to be
 * bounded by the limit plus the maximum number of supported flows.
 *
 *
 * "Flow Removed" messages
 * =======================
 *
 * The flow monitor mechanism is independent of OFPT_FLOW_REMOVED and
 * NXT_FLOW_REMOVED.  Flow monitor updates for deletion are sent if
 * NXFMF_DELETE is set on a monitor, regardless of whether the
 * OFPFF_SEND_FLOW_REM flag was set when the flow was added. */

/* NXST_FLOW_MONITOR request.
 *
 * The NXST_FLOW_MONITOR request's body consists of an array of zero or more
 * instances of this structure.  The request arranges to monitor the flows
 * that match the specified criteria, which are interpreted in the same way as
 * for NXST_FLOW.
 *
 * 'id' identifies a particular monitor for the purpose of allowing it to be
 * canceled later with NXT_FLOW_MONITOR_CANCEL.  'id' must be unique among
 * existing monitors that have not already been canceled.
 *
 * The reply includes the initial flow matches for monitors that have the
 * NXFMF_INITIAL flag set.  No single flow will be included in the reply more
 * than once, even if more than one requested monitor matches that flow.  The
 * reply will be empty if none of the monitors has NXFMF_INITIAL set or if none
 * of the monitors initially matches any flows.
 *
 * For NXFMF_ADD, an event will be reported if 'out_port' matches against the
 * actions of the flow being added or, for a flow that is replacing an existing
 * flow, if 'out_port' matches against the actions of the flow being replaced.
 * For NXFMF_DELETE, 'out_port' matches against the actions of a flow being
 * deleted.  For NXFMF_MODIFY, an event will be reported if 'out_port' matches
 * either the old or the new actions. */
