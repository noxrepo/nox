Welcome to the NOX network control platform.   This distribution
includes all the software you need to build, install, and deploy NOX in
your network, as well as source code and tools to allow you to develop
your own NOX applications.

This version of NOX is a developers' release.  It is intended to provide
a programmatic platform for controlling one or more OpenFlow switches.
NOX can be extended both in C++ and provides an abstracted interface to
OpenFlow.  This distribution contains a set of example applications and
some built in libraries which provide useful network functions such as
host tracking and routing.

*Note*

NOX relies on OpenFlow as the communication protocol for controlling
switches.
